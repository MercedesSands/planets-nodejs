# planets-nodejs
This is a simple backend application where I praticed my node js and javascript skills. The goal of this project was to find Earth like planets that might support life. No frontend work on this application, the sole purpose was for me to pratice my backend skills. In this project I practiced using a CSV file to help gather the information. The CSV file that was used was the kepler_data CSV.

## How to use

1. Open your choice of code editor
2. Open project then open the termianl and type in node index.js then return key
3. 8 Earth like planets will then pop up in the terminal
